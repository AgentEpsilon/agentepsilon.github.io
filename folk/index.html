      In 1928, Robert W. Gordon came to the Library of Congress as head of the newly-created
      Archive of American Folk-Song. He collected a wide range of songs from a
      variety of informants, making sound recordings of the traditional singers he found
      in order to preserve the melodies of the songs.

    <h2><a onclick="swal('Amazing Grace','I chose this song mainly because it is ingrained in the minds of most Americans. It is a classic with lyrics describing how the singer has endured much, but, due to the Amazing Grace of God, has survived. Interestingly enough, the song has an extra stanza, written by an anonymous author, that sometimes replaces one of the stanzas.');">Amazing Grace</a></h2>

        John A. Lomax, a Texas folklorist, feared that the radio and gramaphone would
        discourage people from making their own music. During the 1930's and 40's,
        he traveled throughout the South with his son, Alan, and a recording machine.
        Together they visited farms, ranches, schoolyards, churches, night clubs, prisons...
        anywhere they could find music to record.

      Frances Densmore, Helen Roberts, Willard Rhodes, and others documented Native
      American Music. They feared that American Indians displaced from their lands
      were at risk of losing their culture. Recording the music was especially important
      for this undertaking, as Indian song texts are often composed purely of
      nonlexical syllables, such as <em>hey</em> or <em>na</em>.
